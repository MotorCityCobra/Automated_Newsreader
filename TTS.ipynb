This, I can say, should not be a surprise, why kid ourselves with thinking that Trump isn't as pozzed as the rest of our fucked government and society is? Why kid ourselves thinking that any of this is salvagable? Everything that is the United States is lost, and many European nations are lost, but we, our people, are not lost and we will rebuild new nations, new lands to protect, and new bonds which will be cherished for as long as honest men persist on. Learn from these mistakes, and vow to never let them happen again. We need organization and I won't stand around and let things go in autopilot any longer. Let's start speaking of organization more often, and with time, change will come.\""
